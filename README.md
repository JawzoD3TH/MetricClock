"In The Name Of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
By (the Token of) Time (through the ages), Verily Man is in loss..."

        The most important thing you must know about this is there is no such thing as an
        "Absolute" Metric Second. The closest I can break it down: 864 milliseconds, 573 micro-
        seconds, 269 nanoseconds, 917 picoseconds, 808 femtoseconds and 200-something attoseconds.

The Gregorian Calendar has been an itch I'm sure many a man would like to scratch!
What if there was no untidy leap year? What if we weren't losing almost a minute everyday?

Here's how the Metric System could help us:

        365 Days in a Year.
        10 Hours in a Day.
        100 Minutes in a Hour.
        100 Seconds in a Minute.
        864.57*ms in a Second.
        7 Days in a Week.
        
        As for months, there are 10 months instead of 12 with a caveat...
        The 1st,3rd,5th,7th,9th months are 36 days.
        The 2nd,4th,6th,8th,10th months are 37 days.

        These months are:
        0 - Pascal
        1 - Archimedes
        2 - Ramanujan
        3 - Agnesi
        4 - Khwarizmi
        5 - Einstein
        6 - Pythagoras
        7 - Fibonacci
        8 - Leibniz
        9 - Jazari

        Relax.
        :P   These are just recommendations, also whether zero-based or 1, I personally
             tend towards the former, it's The Metric System we're talking about after all.
        
Help save humanity! Help save time for all of mankind!
